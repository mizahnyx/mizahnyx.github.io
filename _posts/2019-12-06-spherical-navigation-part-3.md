title: Spherical navigation, part 3
---
Even if I haven't met the original goals of planetary navigation, I aimed higher.
I want Super Mario Galaxy style interplanetary navigation.
That will allow armies of units to expand their empires across worlds and solar systems.

This was the video I used as reference.
I didn't followed it to the letter, as I want separated scripts for planetary gravity and player movements, working together.
The quaternion operations are at least at first glance very different between Godot3D and Unity3D.

Those are the screen recordings of me stumbling, trying to get spherical navigation right.
